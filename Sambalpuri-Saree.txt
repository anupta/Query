Quick Summary: All 10 sarees are woven by the Bhulia community using Cotton fibre. Most use Single Ikat, except the Double Ikat piece which is a notably rarer weaving technique. The Mayurakhi stands out as a festive (Nuakhai) saree, while Bichitrapuri is noted as one of the most enduringly popular designs. Would you like to filter further or explore any specific saree in more detail?

2.	Find sarees with wide border size and traditional Bandha weaving technique - from dspace mcp

Let me try broader searches separately to get better results.Here are the results from the DSpace archive. The archive does not have a dedicated "Bandha" weaving technique as a tagged category — however, it does contain sarees linked to the Bandha tradition via the Sarbandha and Bandhadaya styles. I've pulled all relevant matches and organised them into two clear sections for you:
________________________________________
🧵 Section A — Sarbandha / Bandha-Style Sarees
These sarees carry the Sarbandha tag, which is the traditional Bandha-family textile style of Sambalpuri weaving.

📌 Summary
#	Title	Border	Bandha Style	Fiber

2	Duiphulia Double Ikat Suti	✅ Wide	Sarbandha	Cotton
3	Naphulia Sarbandha	Medium	Sarbandha	Cotton

Only 2 sarees match both criteria (Wide Border + Bandha tradition) — the Traditional Sarbandha Buti and the Duiphulia Double Ikat Suti. Would you like to explore any of these further or adjust the filters?

3.	Which sarees use silk material and floral pattern type? - dspace mcp
Here are the findings from the DSpace archive. The archive does not tag any saree with a dedicated "Floral" pattern type — the closest floral-related designs appear under Motifs and are identified through their titles, subjects, and descriptions (e.g. flower, lotus, phula). I've cross-referenced all silk sarees and floral-linked designs and organised everything below:
________________________________________
⚠️ Exact Match: Silk + Floral Pattern — None Found
No saree in the archive is tagged with both Silk fiber and a Floral pattern type simultaneously. Here's why, broken down clearly:
________________________________________
🧵 All Silk Sarees in the Archive (5 found)
All silk sarees use Tussar Silk and are tagged under Motifs — not Floral.

4.	List sarees created after 2020 with chakra motifs. - dspace mcp
Here are the findings after an exhaustive search across multiple related terms in the DSpace archive.

8.	Which sarees feature geometric Bandha designs? - dspace mcp
Here are the complete findings after searching across all Bandha-family terms and geometric-related patterns throughout the archive.
________________________________________
❌ "Geometric Bandha" as a Tagged Design — Not Found
The archive does not tag any saree explicitly as "geometric Bandha." However, the Bandha textile family is inherently rooted in structured, repeating geometric compositions created through the Ikat-tying process. All Bandha-linked sarees below carry that geometric character by nature of the tradition. Additionally, the Pasapalli weaving technique — a chess-board grid pattern — is the closest explicitly geometric design system in the archive and is included for context.

🧵 Section A — All Bandha-Family Designs (5 found)
These are every saree linked to the Bandha tradition (via Sarbandha, Bandhadaya, or Bandhodaya tags), all of which use geometric repeat structures inherent to Bandha weaving.

9.	Retrieve items with symbolic cultural motifs used in Odissi dance.-dspace mcp
Here are the full findings after an exhaustive search across all symbolic, cultural, dance, and ritual-related terms in the archive.
________________________________________
❌ Odissi Dance — Not Found in Archive
"Odissi" and "dance" do not appear anywhere in the DSpace archive — not as an occasion, subject, description, or motif context. The archive does not catalogue any saree specifically for Odissi performance use.
However, Odissi dance costumes traditionally draw from the same pool of symbolic cultural motifs — nature imagery, divine figures, mythological references, and national emblems — that are woven into ceremonial and festive Sambalpuri sarees. Every saree below carries one or more of these symbolic layers. They are organised by the type of cultural symbolism they carry.

These sarees encode animals and natural elements that hold deep symbolic meaning in Odishan cultural and artistic tradition.

📌 Western Odisha Artisan Cluster Summary

________________________________________
🗺️ Geographic Context
Western Odisha (primarily Bargarh, Sambalpur, Sonepur, and Bolangir districts) is the heartland of Sambalpuri textile tradition. Key artisan clusters include:
•	Barpali (Bargarh) — Major weaving hub
•	Sambalpur — Historic center of Sambalpuri sarees
•	Sonepur — Known for specific motif traditions
The Bhulia community dominates production (48 sarees in the archive), while the Meher community represents a smaller, distinct artisan cluster (1 saree found). The Kapti saree (narrow-width format) is a regional specialty unique to this zone.

13.	Which sarees were created by Kostha weavers? - dspace mcp
Let me check what weaver communities actually exist in the archive by searching more broadly.---
❌ Kostha Weavers — Not Found in Archive
After an exhaustive search across all related terms, Kostha weavers (and all spelling variants including Kosta) do not appear anywhere in the DSpace Sambalpuri Saree archive.
________________________________________
📌 Complete Weaver Community Breakdown
Based on all searches conducted throughout this session, the archive contains sarees from only 2 weaver communities:
Weaver Community	Count	Sarees
Bhulia	48	Dominant community — representing the vast majority of archive holdings
Meher	1	Duiphulia Double Ikat Suti Saree (Handle: 123456789/88)
Total	49	
________________________________________
🔍 Why Kostha Is Not Present
The Kostha (or Kosta) weaving community is historically significant in Odisha textile traditions, particularly known for silk weaving in regions like Maniabandha and Nuapatna. However, this archive — focused specifically on Sambalpuri sarees from the Bargarh-Sambalpur region of Western Odisha — appears to only document works from the local Bhulia and Meher communities.
Kostha weavers typically operate in different geographic clusters (Central and Coastal Odisha) and specialize in different textile traditions (particularly silk sarees like Bomkai and Sonepuri), which may explain their absence from this Western Odisha-focused Sambalpuri archive.
